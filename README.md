# class-example
A demo example for classes

## Recommendations and best practices:

0. Strong recommendation: install Atom on your computer and install python-ide (open source tool similar to Pycharm with Kite, alternatively, PyCharm with Kite).
1. Start a main file in the root directory (main.py): Arranged in the order: 1. imports 2. GLOBALS 3. class instantiations 4. functional description fo the task as a function, 5. the task function called nested in if __name__ == "__main__":
2. Create a parent class and package it (beverage.beverage.Beverage, empty file __init__.py) (this becomes like a form for describing a drink, with some functions or class methods to re-write itself)
3. Create a child class: Tea (done as an example)
4. Create a child class: Green Tea (exercise to try)
5. Now run main.py.
